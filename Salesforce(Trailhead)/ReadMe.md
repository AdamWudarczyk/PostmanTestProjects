Before copy and pasting test cases I created, you need to make few steps:

1. Register in (https://trailhead.salesforce.com/)
2.  Go here: https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/starting_force_com/starting_intro?trailmix_creator_id=strailhead&trailmix_slug=prepare-for-your-salesforce-administrator-credential
3.  Scroll to the bottom and wait until your 'My Trailhead Playground 1' will be ready to use. Than launch it.
4.  To connect with Salesforce API follow this instructions:

(NOTE: IF IT'S EASIER FOR YOU, YOU CAN WATCH THIS YT TUTORIAL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx-NLWEBIUk&ab_channel=YourCoddingBuddy)

5. After you complete instructions from step 4. go to 'Salesforce Platform APIs'(or whatever you called your collection)/ REST(folder) / 'Version' request.
6. Send a request to see if it's working (for me it's working when I send it throught POSTMAN opened in the browser and it's not working in desktop app.
7. After ensuring that everything is working, go to tab 'Tests' and paste Test Casees from 'PostmanTests' file to that tab.
8. Send request and observe results in 'Test Results' tab.

NOTE!!! Some of the test casees are intentionaly written to be FAILED, to show different results.
